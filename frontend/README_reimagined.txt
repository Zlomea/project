Reimagined Chat Frontend
========================

What I changed:
- Replaced the main frontend with a complete modern UI using Tailwind CDN.
- New layout: left contacts, center chat window, right info pane.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly (collapses on small screens).
- Demo JS that can connect to existing Socket.IO backend (falls back to demo data if not available).
- Files updated: index.html

How to use:
1. If you run your existing backend (Socket.IO), the frontend will attempt to connect automatically.
2. Serve the frontend directory (chat/frontend) as static files. Example: `npx http-server chat/frontend -p 3000` or integrate with your current backend's static file serving.
3. Optionally swap Tailwind CDN for your build pipeline if you prefer to compile custom utilities.

Files included in this package:
- index.html  (new UI)
